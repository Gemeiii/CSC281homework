/**
 * Homework 1 for CSC-281.001 Spring 2017
 * 
 * Your codename:
 * 
 * This assignment consists of 7 problems. Problem 1 asks you to modify existing
 * code for three subproblems.The remaining six problems each require you to 
 * write a method that satisfies the requirements stated in their descriptions.
 * 
 * You are required to create a javadoc style comment for each method you
 * create. See the sample method named add3 for an example to follow. 
 * 
 * Your homework will be graded in the following manner:
 * 70 points for correctness.
 * 		10 points per problem.
 * 		Does your input match the expected output exactly?
 * 30 points for following standards. Evaluation considerations for these points:
 *		Did you use vi to craft your code?
 *		Are camel case and Pascal case used correctly?
 * 		Did you follow the the submission instructions properly?

   * PROBLEM 2
   *
   * When a double or float is cast into an integer via (int), the fractional part of the number
   * after that decimal place is thrown away (e.g. 3.3 becomes 3). An example: int x = (int)3.3;
   * 
   * 1) Write a method called "topInt" that takes a double as a parameter and returns an int that
   * is rounded up from the double instead of being rounded down.
   *
   * For example, 4.5 would become 5 (the lack of a decimal point after 5 is important). Take care
   * that your method does not round up numbers with no fractions (i.e. 5.0 should not be rounded
   * up to 6.0).
   *
   * Hint: use a method in the math package that we covered in class.
