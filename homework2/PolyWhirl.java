/**
 * Homework 2 - PolyWhirl
 * 
 * Due: Monday, April 3rd at 11:59pm. Follow the standard homework submission guidelines.
 * 
 * Grading: 70 points for correct completion of all tasks and 30 points for style, creativity, and
 * following instructions. Up to 10 points can be recovered if you successfully complete the bonus.
 * 
 * Tasks:
 * 
 * -Read in shape specifications that consist of 3 numbers: number of sides of the shape, the left
 * coordinate of the center in pixels, and the right coordinate of the center in pixels. There will
 * be one shape per line of input text via standard input.
 * 
 * -Make a list per shape to store instances of that shape.
 * 
 * -Read through each shape specification from the input and add a new instance of that shape to the
 * appropriate shape list. For example, the input of 3 100 100 would result in code like the
 * following in the readAndGenerateShapes method of the Surface class: this.tris.add(new Tri(100,
 * 100));
 * 
 * -Create a set of classes that extend BasicShape with the following number of sides: Tri - 3
 * sided, Quad - 4 sided, Pent - 5 sided, and Hex - 6 sided. Note that these shapes do not need to
 * be regular; each shape can have sides of non-uniform length (e.g. both squares and rectangles are
 * valid Quads.
 * 
 * -Pick a fill and stroke color for each class. Let your inner graphic designer or color theorist
 * shine through!
 * 
 * -Each shape should be ~50 pixels wide (i.e. all of the points should be roughly 25 pixels from
 * the center of the shape).
 * 
 * -Document the classes and methods you create.
 * 
 * -Document the functions that are declared after comments that contain TODO: document.
 * 
 * Bonus: Create an additional class that inherits BasicShape that can draw a regular shape with any
 * number of sides.
